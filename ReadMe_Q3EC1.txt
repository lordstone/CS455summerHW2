This Q3EC1.cpp and Q3EC1.h will give you two options of generate one of multiple fractal pgm files.

if you enter "1" in the first command line, you will be asked to enter the [xmin,ymin] [xmax,ymax] for the fractal range. The file name will be "fractal_single.pgm".

if you enter "2" in the first command line, you will be asked to firstly enter the number of fractal pictures and then you will enter the center coordinates of the ith picture [x,y] and the scale of the fractal (1 set to be the standard [-2,-1]X[1,1], the higher, the more zoomed in the picture will be.). The files will be named as "fractal_" + ith + ".pgm".

Always use one space wil separate all the inputs in one line.
