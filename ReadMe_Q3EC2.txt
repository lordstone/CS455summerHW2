You can generate a series of fractals of one center with consecutive zooming scales and generates graphs which can be used to make a animation. 
This program also has built-in centers for use.
Check out the program itself, it has instructions.
IMPORTANT: if you want to make a consecutive animation, you will start from scale 1, the standard scale manderbrot at a defined center, and first start with low interval because in the beginning it zooms very fast, and then you need to accelerate the increase in your interval to accelerate your zoom speed.

a sample command (you need to use the exe multiple times):
1 1 5 (the first five graphs, and so on)
5 2 5
15 5 5
40 10 5
100 20 5
225 50 5
500 100 5
1000 500 5

Enjoy!!
BTW, I will post sample video.
